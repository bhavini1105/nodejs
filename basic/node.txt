1. What is Node.js?

- Node.js is a tool that lets you run JavaScript outside of a web browser
- Normally, JavaScript runs in your browser to make websites interactive.
- Node.js allows JavaScript to run on your computer or server, so you can use it to build things like apps, websites, or tools.

- Node.js turns JavaScript into a versatile, server-side programming language.

- Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript. It lets you run JavaScript code on your computer, server,
  or any environment outside a web browser. 
  
- Itâ€™s built on Google's V8 JavaScript Engine, which is 
  the same engine that powers Google Chrome, making it fast and efficient.

- Node.js is a powerful tool for developers to build fast, modern, and scalable applications, 
  all while using JavaScript as the programming language.

Why is Node.js Special?

- Single-Threaded and Non-Blocking:

  Node.js uses a single thread to handle multiple tasks at the same time.
  This is possible because of its event-driven architecture, which allows it to handle tasks 
  (like reading files or making API calls) without waiting for them to finish.

- Asynchronous Programming:

  Node.js performs tasks in the background (asynchronously), freeing up resources for other tasks. 
  This makes it great for building fast and scalable applications.

- Lightweight and Fast:

  Node.js uses fewer resources compared to traditional server setups, making it fast and efficient.

2. what is server ?

- A server is a computer or program that provides services, data, or resources 
  to other computers or devices, which are called clients.

- A server is a computer or program that gives you what you ask for.

Key Points:

1. Handles Requests: 
- Clients (like your phone, laptop, or browser) send requests to the server for information or services.

2. Sends Responses: 
- The server processes the request and sends back the required information or action.

- a server is like a helpful computer that listens to your requests and gives you what you ask for.
